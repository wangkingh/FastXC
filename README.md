# üí°Project Introduction
High Performance Noise Cross-Corelation Computing Code for 9-component Recordings

Using a high-performance CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing framework, this program is designed to efficiently compute single/nine-component noise cross-correlation functions (NCFs) from ambient noise data. It integrates data preprocessing, accelerated cross-correlation computation, and various stacking techniques (Linear, PWS, tf-PWS), particularly optimizing the computing process using CUDA technology. This significantly enhances processing speed and the signal-to-noise ratio of the data, making it especially suitable for handling large-scale noise datasets.


### Program Features üéâüéâ
1. CUDA-accelerated heterogeneous computing
2. Supports computing both single-component and nine-component cross-correlation functions
3. Employs regex-based file retrieval for SAC files, generally eliminating the need for users to rename files
4. Enables cross-correlation calculation between two seismic arrays
5. Integrates PWS and tf-PWS high-SNR stacking methods (requiring sufficient GPU memory) with CUDA acceleration
6. Separates business logic from low-level computation, allowing users familiar with CUDA and C to customize preprocessing and cross-correlation steps

## üîßInstallation & Requirements
If you are NEW to using a CUDA-based program, Please check the [Environment Setup](#environment-setup) first.
### Python Version
- **Required**: Python 3.8 or higher version.

### Required Third-party Python Modules
- **Libraries**:`obspy`, `pandas`, `scipy`,`matplotlib`, `tqdm`, `numpy`.
- Install the latest versions of these libraries, as only their basic functionalities are utilized. Use the following command to install or confirm installation:
```bash
pip install obspy pandas scipy matplotlib tqdm numpy
```
Or you can use anaconda if you are familiar with that (very suggested choice).

### Compilation
The code is separated into two parts. The `Python` part is designed to allocate computing tasks and address other higher-level issues, while the fundamental computing part is finished using `CUDA-C` or `C.`
For those written in `CUDA-C` or `C`, a compilation step is required. Following the following steps:

```bash
cd FastXC
make veryclean
make
```


## üöÄQuickstart
```python
python run.py
```

## üìùComplete Configuration File Explanation

## üîçComputational Environment Check

To run this CUDA program, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

1. **NVIDIA GPU**: Your computer must have an NVIDIA GPU that supports CUDA.
2. **CUDA Toolkit**: You must install the CUDA Toolkit, which is essential for running CUDA programs. The latest version can be downloaded from the [NVIDIA official website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
3. **GPU Drivers**: Make sure that your NVIDIA GPU drivers are up-to-date to be compatible with the installed version of CUDA.

### Tools Check

Before starting, it is recommended to use the following commands to check if your environment is correctly configured:

- Use the `nvidia-smi` command to check the status of your GPU and drivers.
```bash
nvidia-smi
```
This command will display details about your GPU and the current version of drivers.
```bash
nvcc --version
```
This command helps confirm the CUDA and CUDA compiler (NVCC) version.
