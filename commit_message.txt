Add two new sac2spec methods (new & stable):
- new: Introduce a Gaussian filter to replace the Butterworth filter, improving processing efficiency.
- stable: Use a time-domain Butterworth filter (less efficient, but more stable).

Also, include compile-time options in the Makefile to select GPU architectures based on CUDA Compute Capability, optimizing GPU performance.

You can compile the script in ~/utils and run to check the CUDA Compute Capability of your Device.
